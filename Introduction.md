# What is Java 
Java is both a programming language and a platform. means Java is not just a language. It's also a platform — meaning it provides a whole environment for building and running applications.This environment includes:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Lets you run Java programs.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Lets you write and compile Java programs.
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM): The magic part — it allows Java code to run on any computer, regardless of the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux)
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and general-purpose programming language. That means
- High-level: It's closer to human language (easy to read/write).
- Object-oriented: Based on real-world ideas like objects
- General-purpose: You can use it for almost anything — apps, websites, games, systems, you name it.

# Features of Java 
1. simple
- Java is easy to learn if you know basic programming logic.
- The syntax is clean and readable.
2. Object-Oriented
- Java follows the object-oriented programming model.
- Everything is treated as an object, making code modular and reusable
3. Platform Independent
- Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any system with JVM.
- This makes it "write once, run anywhere
4. Secure
- Java provides a secure runtime environment by avoiding direct memory access.
- It includes features like bytecode verification and a security manager.
5. Robust
- Java provides a secure runtime environment by avoiding direct memory access.
- It includes features like bytecode verification and a security manager.
6. Portable
- Java programs can run on any device or operating system with the JVM.
- This makes Java highly portable and flexible for deployment
7. High Performance
- Java is faster than many other interpreted languages.
- With the help of the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, performance is optimized.
8. Multithreaded
- Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
- This improves performance in applications like games or multimedia apps.

# Why Java is so popular?
1. Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)
- Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This makes Java platform-independent. Developers don’t have to write different code for different operating systems. This portability is one of Java’s biggest strengths.
2. Secure and Reliable
- Java was designed with security in mind. It doesn’t support pointers, which reduces the risk of memory leaks or unauthorized access to memory. It also has features like bytecode verification, exception handling, and a security manager that adds an extra layer of safety, making Java suitable for network-based and enterprise-level applications.
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java follows the object-oriented programming model, which helps in building modular and organized code. Concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation make Java flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain. It is ideal for developing large software systems like banking, inventory management, and enterprise apps.
4. High Performance
- Java is faster than many other interpreted languages such as Python and PHP because of its Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. The JIT compiler converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime, making the execution faster. Java also includes automatic garbage collection, which manages memory efficiently without manual intervention.
5. Platform-Independent
- Unlike languages like C or C++, Java code does not depend on the operating system. Once compiled to bytecode, the code can be executed on any machine with JVM installed. This makes Java highly portable and ideal for cross-platform development.
6. Large Community and Ecosystem
- Java has a massive global developer community. This means a lot of support is available in the form of tutorials, documentation, libraries, and frameworks. For learners and professionals, it’s easier to find help, share knowledge, and build upon existing code.
5. Rich API and Built-in Libraries
- Java provides a rich set of APIs for tasks like networking, input/output, data structures, GUI development, and more. These built-in classes and packages save time and effort for developers and reduce the need to write code from scratch.
6. Enterprise and Industry Use
- Java is widely used in industries like finance, retail, healthcare, and education. Many large organizations and government systems rely on Java for building reliable, scalable, and secure software systems. Its stability over the years has made it a trusted choice in the software industry.
7. Supports Multithreading
- Java has built-in support for multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously within a single program. This is especially useful in applications like games, real-time systems, or any program where performance and responsiveness are critical.
8. Continuous Development and Updates
- Java is maintained and updated regularly by Oracle and the open-source community. With each new version, new features, performance improvements, and security enhancements are introduced, keeping Java modern and efficient.

# Basic syntax of Java
```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
## Explanation:
1. public class HelloWorld {
- public – This means this class is accessible from anywhere.
- class – This keyword is used to define a class (a blueprint for objects).
- HelloWorld – This is the name of the class. It must match the file name (HelloWorld.java).
2. public static void main(String[] args) {
- public – Can be accessed by the JVM from anywhere.
- static – Belongs to the class, not to any object.
- void – It means this method does not return anything.
- main – The method name. Always written like this: main
- String[] args – This is used to accept command-line input. It’s an array of Strings.
3. System.out.println("Hello, world!");
- System – A built-in class that provides access to system-level stuff.
- out – Represents the output stream (where you want to print).
- println() – A method used to print text and then go to the next line.
4. println() – A method used to print text and then go to the next line.
- { } – These curly braces define blocks of code. Each class and method uses them to wrap content.
- ; – Every statement ends with a semicolon in Java. Think of it as a full stop in English.

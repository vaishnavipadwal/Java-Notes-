# What is java 
Java is both a programming language and a platform. means Java is not just a language. It's also a platform — meaning it provides a whole environment for building and running applications.This environment includes:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Lets you run Java programs.
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Lets you write and compile Java programs.
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM): The magic part — it allows Java code to run on any computer, regardless of the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux)
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and general-purpose programming language. That means
- High-level: It's closer to human language (easy to read/write).
- Object-oriented: Based on real-world ideas like objects
- General-purpose: You can use it for almost anything — apps, websites, games, systems, you name it.

# Features of java 
1. simple
- Java is easy to learn if you know basic programming logic.
- The syntax is clean and readable.
2. Object-Oriented
- Java follows the object-oriented programming model.
- Everything is treated as an object, making code modular and reusable
3. Platform Independent
- Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any system with JVM.
- This makes it "write once, run anywhere
4. Secure
- Java provides a secure runtime environment by avoiding direct memory access.
- It includes features like bytecode verification and a security manager.
5. Robust
- Java provides a secure runtime environment by avoiding direct memory access.
- It includes features like bytecode verification and a security manager.
6. Portable
- Java programs can run on any device or operating system with the JVM.
- This makes Java highly portable and flexible for deployment
7. High Performance
- Java is faster than many other interpreted languages.
- With the help of the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, performance is optimized.
8. Multithreaded
- Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously.
- This improves performance in applications like games or multimedia apps.
